This package exposes `ConversionGenerator`, a public struct that fulfills the `Generator` interface in an generic, extensible way to be able to write custom generators for converting similar structs across two (or more) packages.

This repo's `conversion-gen` is a good example of how this generic generator can be re-used with custom settings.
